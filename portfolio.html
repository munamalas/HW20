        <p class="caption">During my time at the UX/UI Design Bootcamp at UC Berkeley, I worked on a variety of projects.  Each of these projects taught me a lot about
          the design process. We learned how to conduct proper research, how to synthesize the results, decide on which fonts/colors were appropriate,
          and more importantly, how to properly showcase our work. 
          <p class="p2"> At first, I believed that I was biting more than I could chew.  This was because up until this point, I was an Undergraduate Research Assistant at Purdue.
           Yes this was a huge jump, but I am glad I decided to take that risk.  If not, I would not have been able to prove to myself that I can embrace any challenge. </p>
          <p class="p3">  I enjoyed creating each of these projects, and I hope you 
          feel the same way as well!  Enjoy!</p>

          <h4 class="title">Project Overview</h4>
          <p class="projectoverview">Our team was asked to design an application that would assist local residents with daily issues.  We decided to focus on recycling because everyone knows at least one person that sometimes does not understand what to do with certain items. </p>

        <p class="scope">Our team spent about 3 weeks on this project.  The timeline seemed short, but we managed to complete the tasks.  
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="problemstatement">
        <h4 class="title">Problem Statement</h4>
        <p class="problem">Many eco-conscious consumers have the desire to donate or recycle as much as possible but become befuddled by complicated rules regarding compost/recycling and lack of knowledge of local donation options for items that thrift stores will not accept. This issue increases the amount of otherwise-useful garbage that ends up in landfills and engenders guilt and frustration in the consumer. A successful solution would provide easily-attainable, fast and straightforward guidance about ideal disposal of household items.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="targetusers">
        <h4 class="title">Target Users</h4>
        <p class="target">We created a user persona named Abigail Choi.  Choi is a 23-year-old student and part-time nanny from Bend, Ohio.  She has a drawer full of unwanted products from her monthly beauty deliveries.  She shops and donates to thrift stores regularly.  Her main goal is to reduce the number of items going into the landfill so she does not feel like a burden on the planet.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div class="process">
        <h4 class="title">Process and Results</h4>
        <p class="steps">
                <p>-We conducted 15 user interviews (5 user interviews per person).  Each individual was asked 25 questions regarding their recycling habits.  Our team also created an online survey through Google forms.  There were 11 questions.  We published the survey through 2 facebook accounts and received 42 responses.</p> 
               <p>-We organized the results and figured out the main points that our application should focus on.  In addition, we created our user persona, Abigail Choi.</p>
                -After that, we created a user flow that shows how Abigal Choi would operate the application, RidMe.</p> 
                <p>-We sketched a paper-version of the application and asked 3 people to test our paper prototype.  We asked users to complete the following tasks: Finding the address of a place to donate art supplies, and determining a safe dispoal method for an empty bottle of Drano. 
                </p> 
                <p>-Our testing showed that users were able to complete the tasks.</p>   
                <p>-After that, we made an iOS mockup using Adobe XD.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="takeaway">
        <h4 class="title">What did this project teach me?</h4>
        <p class="teach">From the original user flow to the iOS clickable prototype, there was a lot of growth and development on the screen and off the screen. Although there's always room for improvement, “RidMe” became a product we enjoyed creating and are proud of. As a group, we also grew together through similar and different thought processes and the union of our own creativity.

        <div class="future">
        <h4 class="title">What do I want to do in the future for this project?</h5>
         <p class="what">During this project, one of our TA's pointed out that we could design this application for other devices such as Android.  Our team thought it was insane, but deep down I believed that this would be an interesting challenge.  
          I decided to go for it, and created a basic prototype for Android screens.  If I had more time, I would like to add more to this prototype.

      <h4 class="title">Timeline & Scope</h5>
      <p class="scope2">Our team spent about 4 weeks on this project. This project did have its challenging moments.  We learned that government organizations tend to provide a vast amount of information to the users.  It took us a while to filter out the unnecessary information.
        <br>I wanted to challenge myself with this project.  So I created a flow where users can view the application in Telugu.
      </p>
      </div>

      <div class="problemstatement2">
      <h4 class="title">Problem Statement</h4>
      <p class="problem2">The current website for the Employment Development Department is very challenging to comprehend.  Many users are having a difficult time completing the necessary tasks.

      </div>

      <div class="targetusers2">
      <h4 class="title">Target Users</h4>
      <p class="target2">The Employment Development Department is for users who are looking to either file claims (e.g. Unemployment Insurance) or search for jobs.
      </div>

      <div class="process2">
      <h4 class="title">Process and Results</h4>
      <p class="steps2">
        *Note: Our team did conduct the research together.  Once the research was done, we created our individual prototypes.  I focused on the flow for "searching for a job".
       <br> -We asked a total of 5 users to test the current website for the EDD.  Every user had difficulty navigating certain aspects of the website.
       <ol>-We asked the users to complete the following:
        <br>File a Claim
        <br>Find a Job
        <br>Translate the website from English to German and back to English again.
        <br>Locate the nearest Disability office.
        <br>Access the high contrast setting.
        </ol>
        -We determined that the main areas that needed to be focused on were filing a claim and searching for a job.
       <br> -We created an information hierarchy for organizing the content of the new website. 
       <br> -I was in charge of creating the flow for the job search.  I took the results of the user testing and created a wireframe for how I believed the screens should look.
        <br>-I submitted my initial designs to my Project Manager, Jenny, who then gave me feedback.
        <br>-After a couple of iterations, I created a mockup of the new website for the EDD.  
       <br> -Our team asked a total of 3 people to test our new website.  We asked them to complete the following tasks: Search for a job, File a Claim, and translate the application from English to Telugu and back.
        <p>
        <br>When we asked the users to compare our design to the current website, everyone agreed that our design was better.  Our design was more fluid and easy to comprehend.  
       </p>
       </div>

      <div class="takeaway2">
      <h4 class="title">What did this project teach me?</h4>
      <p>Patience.  The number one lesson we learned from this project was patience.
        The Employment Development Department provided a vast amount of information.
        It took us a while to understand what was going on with each of the forms.
        We had to Google half of the vocabulary that was used for each of the forms.
        Once we understood each of the forms, it was easy for us to categorize 
        the information.

      </p>
      </div>

      <div class="future2">
      <h4 class="title">What do I want to do in the future for this project?</h5>
       <p class="future22">I told one of my cousins that I was working on re-designing the website for the EDD (Employment Development Department).  She thought that I was 
         hired by the agency to re-design their website. She had visited the current website and was irritated at how long 
         it took her to find one simple form.  I showed her my design, and she was able to easily complete the tasks I gave her.
         If I had more time, I would like to showcase my design to other people and maybe eventually pitch my design to the agency.
         Maybe they'll like, maybe they won't but either way I am proud of what I created.

<h4 class="title">Problem Statement</h4>
<p class="problem4">Many individuals decide they want to take a vacation.  However, there are a few who are intimidated by the planning aspect.  This is particularly the case when they have to plan their budgets.  Budget Planner helps individuals create a budget and make sure that the user does not cross their limits no matter how tempting it can be.
</p>
</div>

<div class="targetusers4">
<h4 class="title">Target Users</h4>
<p class="target4">Budget Planner is an ideal application for users who are busy workers.  I created a user persona named Adelaide Van Hoyt.  Hoyt is a recent college graduate currently working as a Software Engineer at Microsoft.  She does not have a problem with planning a vacation, but she falls prey to shopping.  As a result, Adelaide wants to find a way to make sure that she sticks to her budget.
</p>
</div>

<div class="process4">
<h4 class="title">Process and Results</h4>
<p class="steps4">
  -Interviewed 5 potential users about their travel habits.
  <br>-Organized the results from my interviews into a Feature Prioritization Matrix.  This allowed me to identify which features to apply when I designed my application.
  <br>-Designed a Competitive Analysis chart.  This allowed me to understand what features are already there and how I could implement some of my own ideas into the design.
  <br>-Sketched out the screens for my application.  This lead to the development of the wireframe.
  <br>-Converted my wireframe to iOS mockups using Adobe XD.
  <br>-I asked 2 people to test my application.  Their job was to see if they could accomplish the following tasks: 
  <br><ol>Create a name for the trip
  <br>Be able to see notes <br>View the camera setting for scanning receipts <br> View the done button.
  <br>Be able to see the screen with the budget analysis.
</ol>
Both of the users were able to accomplish the tasks without any issues.
 </p> 
</div>

<div class="takeaway4">
<h4 class="title">What did this project teach me?</h4>
<p class="future4">Before I took this course, I used to be an Undergraduate Research Assistant at Purdue University.  I had the opportunity to work with the Industrial Engineering Lab. We were designing an app related to teenage driving.  Our team was split into two groups. The group I was in focused more on organizing the layout and conducting research while the other group focused on designing the actual application.  When I joined this Bootcamp and started designing this, I initially thought that I was biting more than I could chew. Turns out I was wrong. It was challenging, but now I realized that I can actually design applications.  I know I still have a long way to go, but for now, I am proud of what I created and I hope you enjoyed it as well!
